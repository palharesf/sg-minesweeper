# sg-minesweeper
## What is it?
sg-minesweeper is a small project I decided to develop as a personal challenge and learning opportunity, as well as another fun way to hide giveaway links and codes. It is built by a SG community member, to the SG community, and hence, it's features are meant to make sense to that community, not necessarily to the general public

## How to use it
