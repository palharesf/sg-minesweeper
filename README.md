# sg-minesweeper

## What is it?

sg-minesweeper is a small project I decided to develop as a personal challenge and learning opportunity, as well as another fun way to hide giveaway links and codes. It is built by a SG community member, to the SG community, and hence, it's features are meant to make sense to that community, not necessarily to the general public

## How to use it

When you land on the main page, you'll be prompted with a difficulty toggle, a secret input box, and a "Generate" button.
After choosing the difficulty and entering the secret you want to hide, you click the "Generate" button and a link will be generated containing your difficulty parameters and your encoded secret.

The link will bring you to the game page.
To win the game, you need to achieve two conditions: every non-mine square must be revealed, and every mine must be flagged.
To reveal a cell, just left-click (or tap on mobile); to flag a cell, right-click (or long-press on mobile).
If you hit a mine, you have to refresh the page.

Once you've won the game, you'll be able to see the secret that the game's creator hid.

## Can I play on my phone?

It worked on mine. Short-press for opening squares, long-press to set flags, it should be fine.
I haven't tried to create a giveaway through my phone, but I don't see why it wouldn't work

## Who deserves credit here?
I would be remiss if I didn't mention a few specific SG members:

- [Carlo](https://www.steamgifts.com/user/Carlo) - For the original idea. It was their suggestion that sparked the bulb in my head and moved me to action
- [RosimInc](https://www.steamgifts.com/user/rosiminc) - For the SG nono project. Not only I had incredible fun playing it over and over and over, but their project served as the template for mine, both in terms of code as well as deployment
- [yannbz](https://www.steamgifts.com/user/yannbz) - Similar to RosimInc, but with the Wordle game. Except that I hate Wordle and played their project once hahaha but jokes aside, the project has been quite successful and popular with a segment of the SG community, and I can appreciate and respect that as well
- [Grogglz](https://www.steamgifts.com/user/Grogglz) - For creating a kind thread that eventually led to Carlo's comment that sparked the whole thing. Without your fun challenge there would be no minesweeper
